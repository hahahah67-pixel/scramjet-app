<h1 align="center">Scramjet Demo</h1>

The demo implementation of <a href="https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/scramjet">Scramjet</a>, the most advanced web proxy.

<a href="https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/scramjet">Scramjet</a> is an experimental interception based web proxy designed with security, developer friendliness, and performance in mind. This project is made to evade internet censorship and bypass arbitrary web browser restrictions.

#### Refer to <a href="https://github.com/HeyPuter/browser.js">browser.js</a> where this project will now receive updates outside of just bypassing internet censorship.

## Supported Sites

Scramjet has CAPTCHA support! Some of the popular websites that Scramjet supports include:

- [Google](https://google.com)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com)
- [Instagram](https://instagram.com)
- [Youtube](https://youtube.com)
- [Spotify](https://spotify.com)
- [Discord](https://discord.com)
- [Reddit](https://reddit.com)
- [GeForce NOW](https://play.geforcenow.com/)

Ensure you are not hosting on a datacenter IP for CAPTCHAs to work reliably along with YouTube. Heavy amounts of traffic will make some sites NOT work on a single IP. Consider rotating IPs or routing through Wireguard using a project like <a href="https://github.com/whyvl/wireproxy">wireproxy</a>.

# Update system

You will need Node.js 16.x (and above) and Git installed; below is an example for Debian/Ubuntu setup.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Install required packages

```
sudo apt install -y curl git nginx
```

Clone this Scramjet-App repo

```
git clone https://github.com/hahahah67-pixel/Scramjet-App.git
cd Scramjet-App
```
# Install NVM (Node Version Manager)

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash

```
# Load NVM into current shell

```
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"

```
# Install and use Node.js

```
nvm install 20
nvm use 20

```
# Install pnpm if not installed

```
npm install -g pnpm

```
# Install project dependencies

```
pnpm install

```
# Start the server

```
pnpm start


```

### HTTP Transport

The example uses [libcurl-transport](https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/libcurl-transport) to fetch proxied data encrypted.

You may also want to use [epoxy-transport](https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/epoxy-transport), a different way of fetching encrypted data.

This example also now uses [wisp-js/server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mercuryworkshop/wisp-js) instead of the now outdated wisp-server-node. Please note that this can also be replaced with other wisp implementations like [wisp-server-python](https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/wisp-server-python) which is highly recommended for production.

See the [bare-mux](https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/bare-mux) documentation for more information.
